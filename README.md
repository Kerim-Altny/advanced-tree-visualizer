> An interactive, educational tool to visualize Binary Search Trees, self-balancing AVL Trees, and Red-Black Trees with real-time animations, rotations, and step-by-step analysis.

## 🎯 About The Project

I developed this project as a Computer Engineering student to deeply understand and visualize advanced tree data structures taught in the **DSA** course.

The goal is to demystify complex concepts like **AVL Rotations**, **Red-Black Recoloring**, and **Recursive Traversals** by providing a fully interactive simulation environment.

💡 **Development Method:** Built using the **"AI-Assisted Vibe Coding"** methodology with **Antigravity IDE**, focusing on architectural logic and high-performance rendering.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌲 Supported Tree Structures
* **BST (Binary Search Tree):** Standard logic. Great for visualizing worst-case scenarios (unbalanced linear chains).
* **AVL Tree:** Self-balancing tree. Automatically maintains $O(\log n)$ height.
    * Visualizes **Single Rotations** (LL, RR) and **Double Rotations** (LR, RL) in real-time.
* **Red-Black Tree:** Complex self-balancing structure.
    * Visualizes **Color Flipping (Recoloring)** and **Restructuring**.
    * optimized for Dark Mode with high-contrast Red/Black node designs.

### 🎮 Interactive Controls
* **Infinite Canvas:** Full **Zoom & Pan** support. Navigate large trees by dragging the canvas and zooming with the mouse wheel.
* **Playback Modes:**
    * **Auto:** Smooth, continuous animations.
    * **Step-by-Step:** Pauses at every comparison/operation, allowing users to proceed manually with a "Next" button.
* **Live Statistics:** Real-time dashboard showing **Tree Height**, **Total Nodes**, and **Leaf Node** count.
* **Animation Speed:** Adjustable slider to slow down complex operations for better analysis.

### 🔍 Operations & Traversals
* **Core Operations:** Insert, Delete, Search (with visual path tracking).
* **Traversals:** Euler Tour visualization for **PreOrder**, **InOrder**, and **PostOrder** traversals with directional indicators.
* **Random Tree Generator:** Instantly builds random trees to test balancing logic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** HTML5 Canvas API (for high-performance rendering).
* **Styling:** CSS3 (Modern Dark Theme, Responsive Layout).
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+, Object-Oriented Design).
* **Architecture:** Custom `Node` and `Tree` classes with async animation handling.
